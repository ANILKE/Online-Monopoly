To start the server run the "python3 phase2_demo.py" command.

To start the client run the "python manage.py runserver localhost:'port_no'" command.

Every client needs to be started on different ports and opened in different browsers(cookie issues.)

In order for the game to start, at least 2 clients must be attached to the board as ready.
